Hello HPR listeners and fellow podcasters,
      </h1><h6>hækɜr</h6><p>
This is my first attempt at recording a podcast. Please bear with me. Constructive Feedback is appreciated. And now, I would like to thank all the HPR contributors for their wonderful shows and for keeping this unique community rolling. I have been listening for several months now and I appreciate every show that I have heard. Especially the weird ones. I still need to listen to the rest of those leaked PIN numbers to see if they got mine. I'm afraid the combination to my bike lock is in that list as well.

I've been hacking as long as I can remember. I was the kid who would take apart the toaster to see how it worked... but maybe couldn't quite get it back together and functional again. I don't think I ever did take apart a toaster as a child. But I have taken apart a lot of things. Many of them have been restored to working order. Some have been modified to include new features or push existing features beyond the limits of the original design. Some things have been smashed to smithereens out of curiosity and/or frustration.
         </p><p>
Linux. Hacking isn't linux. Linux may be hacking. You can hack without it. Lots of hackers like to use it. Whatever the case, GNU/Linux is awesome. GNU is nifty. the Linux kernel is pretty bad ass.
               </p><p>
I first heard of linux in the tail end of the '90s. It was only a few years earlier that a friend was overheard asking his brother "What's the Internet?" Later, we found out.
            </p><p>
I was a video game junkie. My brother had a serious temper. He hated to lose a life, not get as many points as he should have, or miss a critical button press by a few milliseconds. At times, he'd take this frustration out on the nearest item to hand... the controller. And sometimes blame the controller itself. And sometimes the controller, in fact, was to blame. Because he'd smashed it earlier and the button reliability was no longer optimal. Mom wouldn't buy a lot of controllers, so I had to try to fix them. I'd re-align the plastic buttons and the rubbery nipples that sit under the buttons so they'd actually contact the circuit board correctly. I could fix broken cases and missing screws with tape. I could fix malfunctioning cables with wire stripping, copper twisting, and tape. I did give up when the circuit board was cracked and I had no way to solder it. Then I'd whip the controller around by the cord and smash it into some concrete.
         </p><p>
We matured from consoles to PC gaming. In 1993, we got an IBM PC with an Intel 486 DX2 25MHz. When I told a friend at school about it, he said "25MHz? Doom would be awesome on that" and it was. Ah, the glory days... configuring Sound Blaster drivers, DMA, and IRQs. Of course we used it for school work too. We had a nice color dot matrix printer. My English teacher was impressed with the printed clipart that I used in one school project. But it was gaming, I believe, that sparked the passion for the machine. How does it work? How does it connect me to this simulated world? How does it fool me?
      </p><p>
I broke the IBM PC. Well, I borked the OS a number of times, but managed to work out how to re-install DOS (5.something) and Windows (3.1 something). I would compulsively explore every corner of the OS. If I ran into something too complicated or irrelevant to my situation (WTF is this Novell shit for?) But also, the motherboard broke. I don't think that it was my fault because I hadn't started exploring inside the physical box. Mom took it to the department store that sold it to us. And they replaced the motherboard. We had it back up and kicking in no time. Although, it was never quite the same again. This model originally had a feature that was quite unique in its day. If you tripped over the power cable and pulled the plug, the machine would die like any other. But when you re-inserted the power plug, the machine came back to the exact state it had been in. It didn't boot the OS from Zero like every other machine of that era that I've ever encountered. I can only assume that the first motherboard featured a battery or something to maintain the state of the RAM in the event of a power failure. After the repair, it would just start from POST like every other PC.

I loved the Quest for Glory Series. King's Quest was OK. Doom, Doom2, Quake! We'd get an upgrade often enough to keep up with the games that were coming out. hdd capacity went from 100Mb in the first PC to 2 whole Gigabytes in the 200MHz laptop I got to take with me to College in 1998. That laptop, 5 years later and with a busted LCD, became my first in-car mp3 player. I didn't hack it up with linux. I just modified win98 to start winamp instead of explorer.exe. I think this required a 1 line modification to an .ini file. winamp was preconfigured to shuffle a playlist of my entire collection and play at startup. I wanted to be able to skip forward a track or back a track, pause, resume, and nothing else. I didn't want a full keyboard sitting in my center console. So I took the keyboard controller board out of the PS/2 keyboard, traced the circuits from the key switches to the controller pins, threw away the keys and case, and soldered some microswitches to the controller pins for each key I wanted. Since the actual PCB in the keyboard was pretty small, my new controller wrapped in electrical tape with microswitches poking out was pretty small.
</p><p>
Let me get back to Linux. In either '99 or Y2K, my brother threw a magazine at me and told me there was an article about running something besides Windows on a PC. Well, <i>that</i> had my attention. Everyone knew that windows was shit. But that was what you had if you had a PC (And, I mean... What? Were you going to play games on a Macintosh? Don't be ridiculous) So, I took a look at that article. I say article, but it was only a few paragraphs. I could sum it up like this... "There's this thing. It's called Linux. It's an Operating System. It's not Windows, but it runs on a PC. And it sucks for games."
	</p><p>
Well, it does look like there is a ray of hope for linux gaming today. Just in time for everyone to pick up their smart phones for gaming and forget the PC entirely.
		</p><p>
No games? I don't care. What <i>can</i> it do? Quite a lot, it turns out. I followed up with some internet searching (back in them days, we didn't call it "googling"). At first, I was like "Where do I get the .exe to install linux". I did manage to get something running on my brother's PC and was greeted with a (probably bash) prompt. I played with it for a few minutes, knew nothing of Unix or any unix commands. Really, I just wanted to play some Quake or something, so I swapped his windows drive back into the box and forgot about linux for a while.
			</p><p>
Eventually, I installed Debian from a stack of floppies onto a 386 and sat down with all the documentation that looked interesting from tldp.org. Then I learned some shit. did a little bash scripting. started distro hopping. tried every major distro I came across. I paid waaay too much for magazines that included CDs with installers. Sometimes those CDs actually resulted in a running system.
		</p><p>
At some point, I decided that I wasn't really into gaming any more and I should try to run Linux as my primary and only OS. Fuck you, Microsoft. Games are all just a waste of time anyway. Later I would decide I really would like to play some game or other and I'd let Windows back in. But I would always be dual booting or running multiple machines. I may have jumped the fence a few times, but I am now an OSS OS kinda guy. with proprietary drivers and non-free codecs, of course. I mean, I'm not RMS.
	</p><p>
I did include some linux related links at the end of the show notes. Arch is my current distro-of-choice. I'd never tried Arch until a few months ago. I'd never hear of Arch until I started listening to HPR and some other linux audio shows. Arch is awesome. If anyone out there listening to this has been curious about Arch, but turned away because of the complexity of the installation or allegedly steep learning curve. Go get the live image, get a machine to archify, get the beginner's guide pulled up on some other device (maybe on a phone that can display web pages, maybe on a borrowed netbook). You know how a terminal interface works. You know what a Unix shell is (exempli gratia, bash). You probably know how to partition and hard drive and whether you are booting BIOS or UEFI. If you aren't too sure about some of that stuff... there's really not that much you <em>need</em> to know. Boot the Arch live system. You'll get a text console unix shell. Don't Panic. You have a guide to make sure you don't forget any crucial steps... and even if you know what you're doing... without the guide, it's easy to forget something like setting a root password or creating a non-root user. I would not be surprised if it is possible or even trivial for someone installing Arch to beat the fedora installer in a fair linux installation race. Get Arch. dive into wiki.archlinux.org. learn to love the wiki. form the habit of checking the latest news at archlinux.org for any known caveats before updating the system with <code>pacman -Syu</code>.
</p><p>
Next, there is Gentoo. I ran Gentoo for years. Gentoo really is cool. You know you can replace the engine computer in a Toyota with a custom rig to really fine tune the engine timing and so forth. It made a lot of sense to me with what I was doing at the time. Gentoo is a bit like a build-your-own-distro kit. emphasis on build. you'll be running <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code> a lot. The package manager, portage, is pretty handy. But there is <i>a lot</i> you need to know to configure and maintain a Gentoo system. I might be running Gentoo to this day except that my girlfriend was complaining about how much time I spent tweaking and compiling my system. You're always compiling. New security patch? Download that and re-compile the whole package. Whoops, you forgot a <code>USE</code> flag that you needed. Fix <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> and Re-compile the whole package. The Gentoo documentation website works well in the lynx(and links) browser(s) so you can read the installation instructions from the web while you're installing without a second browsing device. I used this trick many times... you'll be doing a lot of stuff on a VT before you even get X compiled.

In the summer of 2002, I printed the full text of <i>Linux From Scratch</i> double-sided on my roommate's inkjet. Then I bought him a new black ink cartridge. I took the pages, designed my own cover, and bound it into a book. By the time I actually got around to installing LFS, the book was outdated and I read it off the web as I worked on a separate box. It was so long ago that I don't remember much except that you'll have to compile a bunch of stuff multiple times. you need to compile gcc so you can compile gcc and so forth. I did run LFS for a short while before I decided that a package manager might be nice.
		</p><p>
I've left out the link for fedora, but I've recently installed f21 and I like it. I can't believe I'm saying it. But I like Gnome 3. I haven't tweaked it much. And it's usually not too-slow-to-use on my 7 year old laptop with a core 2 duo, 3 giggaram, and intel graphics. So now I'm dual-booting again. Only this time there's no proprietary OS involved.
	</p><p>
Let us take another look at games. I'm only going to say "Minecraft" this one time. I never got into it when it was becoming all the rage. But my girlfriend's 6yr. old son has been asking me about it and expressing a desire to get into it. So I've been exploring some of the more open and free alternatives. <a href="skycraft.io">Skycraft</a> is not open source, but I gave them €5 for the Early-bird deal anyway. I'm interested in it because of webgl and running in the browser on pretty much any device. "pretty much any device" barely includes my laptop with its intel graphics and aging silicon. It's really too choppy to play, but that didn't stop me from staying up until 2am digging stairs down into the earth and trying to figure out how to build a castle. It runs well on my girlfriend's newer/better laptop with nVidia chips and dip.
</p><p>
Minetest. The game doesn't look too impressive except that I'm like "Wow, this manages to be very engaging while looking like it should run on the SNES". It has been very engaging today for myself and a kid who has no idea that the SNES was ever a thing. This project excites me because it's open (LGPL 2.1), it's a lego(tm) kit for making blocky games, it runs well on old hardware, and if I wanted to, I could get involved to help make it better.
