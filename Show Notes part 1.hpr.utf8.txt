[Created with command [[cat >> Show\ Notes\ part\ 1.hpr.utf8.txt]]]
Hello HPR listeners and fellow podcasters,

This is my first attempt at recording a podcast.

I will have links.

I will have Stories.

The show will unfold in these files. Take the files. use the files. or burn them.

A few things I want to do... I want this to be my "How I got into --linux-- H4ͻkÏnģ"

                             I want this to be A RANT!

                             I want this to spark a discussion on the potential for Free and Open Source Software, Hardware, and Life.
                                                                                                                                  ^-> Open Source Universe

I have to apologize. I used some strange characters above... if you have trouble parsing that, 
"H4ͻkÏnģ" is "Hacking" or "hækɪŋ". One who does it is a hækɜr.

	I love UTF-8 on the terminal.

[This file has been slated for HEAVY EDITING]
[Now it will be saved]
[Later it will be opened again with vim. A fork will be created and will eventually have all of these comments removed.]
[If you are reading this file, it was only left in for posterity. please see the final edit in "Show Notes part 1.final.hpr.utf8.txt"]
